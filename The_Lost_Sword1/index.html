                    You live in a small village, where once everything was happiness and joy.
                    Until as the legend said, an evil wizard came and took control of the minds
                    of all people, you are the only one who escaped the spell and you know the
                    legend. "The only one with a clear mind will be the carrier of Lightbringer
                    the magic sword…" so you need to go and search the sword that will defeat
                    the wizard and release your people.

                    You try to remember what the legend says about the location of the sword,
                    but you only remember a few words. "The fairy will guide the path" so, which
                    way will you take, the left to the Dark Forest or the right to the Enchanted
                    ruins?

                    Now you are in the dark forest, you can barely see, is misty and the floor
                    it's muddy. Suddenly a fairy appears and she tells you to follow her. But she
                    flies so fast that you can't follow, you continue to walk until the path
                    forks, and there is a sign "West: Forgotten Swamps, East: Mountains of fire".

                    Now you are in the enchanted ruins, you can hear whispers everywhere but you
                    can't see anybody; maybe the fairies. Behind a wall you hear a voice that
                    tells you choose right... right... but you keep walking until you arrive to
                    a dead end, you decide to turn back but everything looks different, you feel
                    lost, at the end of the corridor you can see two doors one beside the other
                    and each one has a legend the right door you can read "Endless Plains" in
                    the left one "River of Desires" which way you will go?

                    You arrive to the forgotten swamps, smells like rotten eggs. You see a couple
                    of crocodiles; you need to be cautious here. Walking in the swamps the water
                    reaches your knees. Suddenly you feel that something pulls your ankle, you fall
                    down and a rock hits your head. Your head bleeds but you feel right to continue,
                    now you realise that you can remember the final part of legend "...the
                    Lightbringer sleeps in an ancient place with the dead lords" When you get to the
                    end of the swamps you will you go to Castle Black or to the Temple of the Seven?

                    When you arrive to the mountains of fire instantly you feel the heat of the
                    lava, you can detect the sulfur in the air, it's hard to breathe. It's a
                    difficult path; out of the blue a lava explosion sends you down and a big
                    rock hits your head, it all turns black. When you wake up your realize that
                    you passed out. For some reason now you can remember the last part of
                    the legend "...the Lightbringer sleeps in an ancient place with the dead
                    lords" you need to decide now if you will take the "Lava path" or go through
                    the mountain to the "Dwarven Mines"?

                    moving in the river, curiously you go to se what it is and a beautiful siren
                    appears. She asks you to follow her into the river, she says she has something

                    and dirty. You are starting to feel hopeless, but you just continue walking
                    because you know that your friends and family need you, at some point you see
                    the mountains. You know that if you cross the mountains you will arrive to the
                    "Death Valley", but if you go west you will get to the "Great Desert". What

                    the main chamber and near the throne you can see something shining, the sword?
                    you walk toward that shiny thing and when you are close enough you see a sword...
                    but, that is not Lightbringer, you take the sword to be sure and suddenly
                    someone appears, he has a crown and starts yelling "thief! thief! my sword!".
                    He starts attacking you, you try to defend yourself, but he gets the sword and
                    cross it through your chest. You are killed by the Mad King. Sorry you lose...

                    doors of the last chamber you can see a big hole in the ground, looks endless.
                    Then you start to hear cries, hundreds of cries, and the lost souls
                    of the dead start rising through the hole. You try to escape, but finally one grabs
                    your arm and throws you to the hole of the oblivion. Sorry you lose...

                    You try to return, but a river of lava is now blocking the way. You continue the
                    other way until you get to a dead end. The lava is behind you and you don't have
                    anywhere to run. The lava slowly begins to approach and you have nothing to
